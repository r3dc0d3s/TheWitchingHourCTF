**Scenario: Redundant Broadcast (Static)**

A system broadcasted the same emergency message to three separate command centers, each with a different public key. We've captured all three transmissions in the file `challenge2.txt`.

**Objective:**
Recover the original secret message from the intercepted ciphertexts in `challenge2.txt`.
