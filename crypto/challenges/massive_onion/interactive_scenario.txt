**Scenario: The Massive Onion**

We've intercepted a deeply nested data structure, an "onion" with many layers of encoding. Our analysts believe the encoding is a simple two-step process, repeated many times. However, the number of layers seems to change with each transmission.

**Objective:**
Connect to the server, retrieve the onion, and peel back the layers to find the flag at the center.

**Connection:**
`nc localhost 1342`
